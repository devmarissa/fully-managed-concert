Currently Lune is having issues, so we won't be using that or Asphalt, but the structure is there if we need it.

Asphalt applies to the init.luau in assets, and the images in assets, as well as the 2 .toml files.

Lune applies to the models in assets, as well as map and lighting folders that do not exist inside the repo currently.
